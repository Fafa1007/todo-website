# todo-website

This is my second front-end website, which is a simple task manager webapp,
although once again, I have only done the homepage with little javascrip involved and no backend code.

This is also the first project that I have used Figma, a UX website designing app, first to model the type of website I wanted to make.
I then tried my best to create what I designed using HTML, CSS and some javascript.
